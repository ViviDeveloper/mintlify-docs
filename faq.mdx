In school. 23rd May 2023, I find on discord a amazing bot named "Mimu". I liked the bot so much! So I got idea to my custom "mimu" with more features like moderatiom, antinuke, automod and amazing better economy. Two years later I get flashback to make the bot, so with `@adushkaa`. It was my dream to make bot with my friend! Adushkaa really help me with learning scripting!
